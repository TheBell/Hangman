/**
 * A HangmanManager keeps track of the state of a game of hangman.
 * Methods provide access to the current set of guesses,
 * number of wrong guesses remaining, and the current pattern
 * to be displayed to the user.
 * The <CODE>record</CODE> method updates state by recording a new guess
 * and updating the other values appropriately.
 * <P>
 * Implementing classes must include a constructor of the following form:
 * <PRE>
 * public HangmanManager(final List<String> dictionary,
 *                       final int length,
 *                       final int max)
 * </PRE>
 * This constructs a HangmanManager by first determining the initial
 * set of words with the specified length from the dictionary
 * then selecting the goal.
 * <UL>
 * <LI>The dictionary parameter is a list of candidate goal words.</LI>
 * <LI>The length parameter is the length of acceptable candidate goal words.</LI>
 * <LI>The max parameter is the maximum number of wrong guesses permitted.</LI>
 * <LI>The constructor throws and IllegalArgumentException if length < 1.
 * or if max < 0.</LI>
 * </UL>
 * </P>
